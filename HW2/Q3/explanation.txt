There are two main reasons to use logarithmic scales in charts and graphs. The first is to respond to skewness towards large values; i.e.,
 cases in which one or a few points are much larger than the bulk of the data. The second is to show percent change or multiplicative factors.

As the number of earthquaqes for different scales [5_5.9] to [8.0+] varies in a different scale, it is very important 
to change the scale of the y axis in a way that it is easy to see the number of occurances in the y axis. Two solutions are implemented one based on the 
square root scale and the other based on the log scale. The log scale increases the range for the smaller values and decreases the values for the larger amounts.
The square root scale also have similar impacts to log scale.Generally, square root is weaker than the logarithm and the cube root.
It is also used for reducing right skewness, and also has the advantage that it can be applied to zero values. Note that the square root of an area has
the units of a length. It is commonly applied to counted data, especially if the values are mostly rather small.
